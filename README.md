# Steve

Steve is a macOS application that enables AI to interact directly with your computer. It is being developed by AI agents, with the code remaining private until we reach a stable V1 release. The goal for V1 is to develop an L1 AI Agent which is an AI agent that can operates automated but still requires some human-in-the-loop. L2 AI Agent will be end game.

## V1 Roadmap
- [x] Repository, Frontend and Backend Setup
- [x] Clipboard Integration
- [x] Integration of custom Python Code
- [x] Integration of pre-defined Extensions
- [ ] OpenAI Integration
- [ ] Finder Integration
